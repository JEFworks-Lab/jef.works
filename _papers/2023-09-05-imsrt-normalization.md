abstract: results obtained from gene panels that are more representative of the gene expression of the tissue's component cell types. These effects are not observed without normalization or when scaling factors are not derived from gene counts, such as with cell volume normalization. Overall, we caution that the choice of normalization method and gene panel may impact the biological interpretation of the im-SRT data.
