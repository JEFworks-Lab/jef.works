abstract: Spatially resolved omics technologies provide molecular profiling of cells while preserving their organization within tissues, allowing for the evaluation of cell-type spatial relationships. We developed CRAWDAD to quantify cell-type spatial relationships across length scales. We highlight the utility of such multi-scale characterization on simulated data, recapitulate expected cell-type spatial relationships in tissues such as the mouse brain and embryo, and delineate functionally relevant spatial-defined cell-type subsets in the human spleen.
