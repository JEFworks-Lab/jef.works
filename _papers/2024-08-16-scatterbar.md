abstract: Displaying proportional data across many spatially resolved coordinates is a challenging but important data visualization task, particularly for spatially resolved transcriptomics data. Scatter pie plots are one type of commonly used data visualization for such data but present perceptual challenges that may lead to difficulties in interpretation. Increasing the visual saliency of such data visualizations can help viewers more accurately identify proportional trends and compare proportional differences across spatial locations. We developed scatterbar, an open-source R package that extends ggplot2, to visualize proportional data across many spatially resolved coordinates using scatter stacked bar plots. We apply scatterbar to visualize deconvolved cell-type proportions from a spatial transcriptomics dataset of the mouse olfactory bulb to demonstrate how scatter stacked bar plots can enhance the distinguishability of proportional distributions compared to scatter pie plots.
