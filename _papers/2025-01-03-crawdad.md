abstract: Spatially resolved omics (SRO) technologies enable the identification of cell types while preserving their organization within tissues. Application of such technologies offers the opportunity to delineate cell-type spatial relationships, particularly across different length scales, and enhance our understanding of tissue organization and function. To quantify such multi-scale cell-type spatial relationships, we present CRAWDAD, Cell-type Relationship Analysis Workflow Done Across Distances, as an open-source R package. To demonstrate the utility of such multi-scale characterization, recapitulate expected cell-type spatial relationships, and evaluate against other cell-type spatial analyses, we apply CRAWDAD to various simulated and real SRO datasets of diverse tissues assayed by diverse SRO technologies. We further demonstrate how such multi-scale characterization enabled by CRAWDAD can be used to compare cell-type spatial relationships across multiple samples. Finally, we apply CRAWDAD to SRO datasets of the human spleen to identify consistent as well as patient and sample-specific cell-type spatial relationships. In general, we anticipate such multi-scale analysis of SRO data enabled by CRAWDAD will provide useful quantitative metrics to facilitate the identification, characterization, and comparison of cell-type spatial relationships across axes of interest.
