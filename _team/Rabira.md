description: Hello there! I'm an incoming junior at Montgomery Blair Highschool and have always had a passion for science and the search to solve our society's biggest issues. Computer science was a skill I began taking course for two years ago, alongside my passion for microbiology I think that studying the gene expressions of various organ tissue across the body can open our eyes to the world of gene mapping and understand at a fundamental level why certain things happen. I enjoy public policy and pushing for pubic health reform, journalism, and the drums.
