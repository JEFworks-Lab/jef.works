name: Brendan Miller
title: Post-doctoral Fellow
description: During my time in the JEFworks lab, I developed open-source computational pipelines and statistical software to characterize and visualize cell type spatial organizational patterns in tissues. Two of my projects are now published and available as downloadable software (`MERINGUE` and `STdeconvolve`). A third project, `CRAWDAD` (Cell-type Relationship Analysis Workflow Done Across Distances) has been successfully handed off to another talented member of the lab and is nearing completion. For the next phase of my career, I will be joining the Spatial Transcriptomics and Multi-omics Sequencing Team at Merck as a Senior Scientist, Spatial Transcriptomics and Computational Biology.
