title: Graduate Student
description: I am a first-year PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Hopkins. My hope is to develop user-friendly computational software specifically tailored for biologists who may not be tech-savvy. I was recently introduced to spatial transcriptomics and was immediately captivated, so I am thrilled to explore this field during my rotation with Dr. Fan! When I'm not busy with research, you'll find me playing/watching sports, hanging out with friends, or watching movies :)
