title: Graduate Student
description: I am currently a first-year PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Hopkins. My ultimate goal is to develop user-friendly computational software specifically tailored for biologists who may not be as tech-savvy. My research focus lies in deciphering the intricate connection between spatial gene expression and tissue architecture in 2D, with the goal of broadening these insights into 3D applications. When I'm not busy with research, you'll find me playing/watching sports, hanging out with friends, or watching movies :)
