description: I am a undergraduate student majoring in computer science and chemical & biomolecular engineering at Johns Hopkins. I have had previous lab and research experience in cellular biology, computational chemistry, and deep learning. I am currently interested in using my technical background to anaylyze data and solve biomedical problems. Outside the lab, I enjoy working out, listening to music, cooking, and watching movies/anime.
