title: Undergraduate Student
description: I am a Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University. I am interested in developing computational techniques and machine learning for biology and health. I have worked on the testing of STdeconvolve and the early development of the cell polarization project. I also have an interest in technology entrepreneurship and have co-founded a student start-up in internal hemorrhage diagnostics. I will be pursuing a PhD at the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology and Medicine program in New York City. In my spare time, I love listening to podcasts including Accidental Tech Podcast, 99% Invisible and the Lex Fridman Podcast.
