title: Post-Bacc Student
description: I am a senior Biomedical Engineering undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I mainly studied immunoengineering and conducted research on T cell-based cancer immunotherapy. I joined JEFWorks Lab because I was fascinated by the application of bioinformatics and data science to the field of biology, especially spatially resolved omics analysis. I am excited to diversify my skillset as a researcher and solve biomedical problems with computational approaches. In my free time, I like to exercise, read, and play video games.
