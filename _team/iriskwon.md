description: I’m an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University from Seoul, Korea, studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. I’m on a journey to create meaningful designs through computational approaches to eradicate health inequities and solve biomedical problems. Outside the lab, I enjoy going to the gym, cycling, attempting digital art, listening to music, and exploring the city with friends!
