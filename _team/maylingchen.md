description: I'm a first-year Biomedical Engineering student at Johns Hopkins University. I have previously worked in this lab to learn how to increase the scalability of spatial omics data analysis and I'm excited to help make this method more accessible to others. Outside of school, I enjoy listening to music, watching documentaries, and making matcha latte for my friends.
