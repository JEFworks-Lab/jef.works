description: Hi! I'm a first year Biomedical Engineering PhD student. I am fascinated by our growing ability to acquire data at various spatiotemporal scales of biology-- from being able to spatially resolve the expression of thousands of proteins inside individual cells to being able to capture the 3D organization of several tissues in critical organ systems, we can now measure disease-relevant features at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ scales. I am interested in applying data-driven and modeling approaches to understand how high-dimensional intracellular data not only translate to cell phenotypes and cell states, but also how this information describes intercellular behaviors such as unique spatial organizations or cell-cell signaling networks. Beyond the lab I am interested in STEM outreach and exploring Baltimore.
