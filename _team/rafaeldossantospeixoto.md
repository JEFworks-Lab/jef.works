description: I am a first-year Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. student at Hopkins. I recently graduated in Control and Automation Engineering at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil. There, I developed software for the analysis of scRNA-seq and SRT data, which I aim to continue during my doctoral studies. In my personal time, I try to explore places and try new activities.
