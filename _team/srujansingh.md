title: Postdoctoral Fellow
description: I am a recent PhD from the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering program at Johns Hopkins University. My expertise lies in the field of bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. As a postdoctoral fellow, I want to work at the intersection of advanced imaging and computational biology, and understand how cell-cell/cell-material interactions and spatio-temporal gene regulation play a role in the context of diseases and tissue regeneration. Outside of lab, I like to run, hike, explore new places and cuisines.
