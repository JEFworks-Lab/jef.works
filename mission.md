# What do we do?
Develop open-source machine learning, statistical, and computational software for analyzing large-scale biological and medical data

# How do we do it?
Through addressing purposeful questions in molecular biology and biomedicine towards an understanding of human health that demand innovative computational solutions

# For whom do we do it?
- For ourselves to satisfy our own intellectual curiosity as well as develop valuable computational skills through project-driven learning
- For the broader scientific community to be able to use our developed computational tools for their own biological research questions
- For the general public to enhance our collective understanding of human disease and ultimately improve healthcare outcomes
